# Frontend Mentor - Stats preview card component solution

This is a solution to the [Stats preview card component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/stats-preview-card-component-8JqbgoU62). 

### My approach
Plain HTML and CSS flexbox was my way to go.

### Difficulties faced
I struggled quite a bit with aligning the contents and giving approriate margin and padding.

### What I learned
To give any image a color blend effect, put it in a div, display the div as flex so that the image stretches the whole div. Then, apply background color to that div and for the image, use mix-blend-mode: multiply. That should do the trick.
